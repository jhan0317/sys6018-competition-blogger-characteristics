# GOALS
Predict the age of blog's authors

Have at MINIMUM one parametric model:
1. Ridge regression
2. Lasso regression

Implement a cross-validation approach:
1. k-fold cross validation

# Bonus
Get a good score on the parametric linear model modeling for bonus credit.

# RESULTS
Ridge regression: 3.88509

# FILES
Code: All of the code.
Data: All of the cleaned data.
Final_submission: All of the final submissions for Kaggle

# Code
# new_blog_script.py: Reads in the raw dataset and conducts basic text analysis
# data_cleaning.py: Reads in the raw dataset and conducts data prepocessing
# tfidf.R: Reads in the raw dataset and calculates the term frequency-inverse document frequency
# linear_model.py: Reads in the cleaned data and tfidf data. Builds the final model


# Final_submission
# blog_result_1008_v4.csv: the result with best score
